            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>This 3rd Party Installation Onboarding Manual serves as a comprehensive guide our company would use for training and onboarding all new third-party installers, providing steps, what to expect, and best practices to help make sure everything goes smoothly.</p>
            <p>The manual includes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Company Overview and Product Line Descriptions:</strong> Introduces the new installation company to our company's background, core values, and product lines to familiarize them with brand expectations and the scope of their installation responsibilities.</li>
                <li><strong>Vendor Setup Requirements:</strong> Outlines necessary credentials, certifications, and documentation needed for vendor registration and setup, ensuring compliance with corporate and regulatory standards.</li>
                <li><strong>Installation Workflow:</strong> Provides a comprehensive breakdown of the installation process, from order acquisition through final site assessment, including key milestones and checkpoints to promote timely, high-quality installations.</li>
                <li><strong>Site Readiness and Scheduling Guidelines:</strong> Offers detailed instructions on evaluating site readiness, coordinating schedules, and preparing for installations, minimizing delays and optimizing efficiency.</li>
                <li><strong>Standards and Documentation:</strong> Lists specific documentation requirements, dress code expectations, and behavior guidelines to maintain professionalism and uniformity across all third-party installations.</li>
                <li><strong>Billing Procedures and Payment Guidelines:</strong> Clearly defines billing protocols and timelines, ensuring transparency and accuracy in payment processing for all partners.</li>
                <li><strong>Troubleshooting and Support Resources:</strong> Includes an escalation matrix and troubleshooting steps to address common installation challenges, along with direct contacts for real-time support.</li>
                <li><strong>Safety Protocols and Team Directory:</strong> Provides unloading safety instructions and a contact list of key personnel, facilitating smooth communication and reinforcing a safety-first approach.</li>

            <p>This manual helps alleviate some of the growing pains we experience with new third-party partners by providing them with the knowledge and tools upfront to conduct successful, efficient, and compliant installations.

            <h2>My Contributions</h2>
            <p>I developed this manual from scratch to assist our team in partnering with new third-party installation companies, helping to expand our footprint in areas where we currently lack resources. I focused on providing as much detail as possible to address any questions a new partner may have, including but not limited to who to contact within our company for assistance with specific topics.</p>
