        <h3>Project 1: Landed Margin Forecasting Tool</h3>

        <p><strong>Description:</strong> The Freight Margin Forecasting Calculator is a strategic tool for management to evaluate the impact of varying bid margins on the landed margin. Due to a rule limiting the freight charge to a maximum of 20% of the customer’s product order total, standard high-margin bids (such as 70%) often result in reaching this cap, thus reducing the effective landed margin. By allowing users to adjust the bid margin, the calculator shows the achievable landed margin under these constraints. This tool enables management to make informed decisions by forecasting the effect of lowering the bid margin, optimizing profitability within regulatory pricing limits.</p>

        <h3>Project 2: Company vs. 3rd Party Freight Model</h3>

        <p><strong>Description:</strong> The Company vs. 3rd Party Freight Model evaluates the potential cost savings of hiring in-house drivers compared to relying solely on third-party carriers. Using a combination of internal order data and public datasets, this analysis estimates the per-mile cost for company-managed freight by factoring in additional expenses for in-house drivers, such as wages, benefits, fuel, and lodging. 

            To support this analysis, Brandon accessed a massive dataset from the Bureau of Economic Research, containing 30+ billion rows of distance data between U.S. zip codes. He developed a custom script to filter this data to include only the relevant zip code (55060), enabling him to calculate delivery distances and compare per-mile costs charged by third-party carriers in various states. Factoring in costs unique to operating in-house, such as vehicle maintenance, fuel consumption, and driver lodging, the model projected annual savings of approximately $239,000, with potential savings exceeding $500,000 when accounting for variable factors.</p>

        <p><strong>Key Insights:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Significant Annual Savings Potential</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>The analysis revealed a potential annual savings of $239,000 by hiring in-house drivers, with additional variable factors suggesting total savings could exceed $500,000.</p></li>

            </li>
            <li><strong>Cost per Mile Comparison</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>Comparing per-mile costs for in-house drivers versus third-party carriers showed that managing freight internally could reduce expenses, especially with state-specific cost variations.</p></li>
                </ul>

        <h3>Project 3: Cost Optimization for Installation Operations: In-House vs. Third-Party</h3>
        <p><strong>Description:</strong> The Cost Optimization for Installation Operations project aimed to determine whether the company would benefit from hiring its own installers within a specific state or continue using third-party installers. The analysis relied on existing order revenue data and third-party installation costs, including travel expenses.</p>
        
        <p>Since the company did not track line-item costs per order, statistical sampling was applied to estimate travel expenses incurred by third-party installers. Using Power BI, a heatmap was created to identify "hot spots" for installations over the past three years, enabling a geographic analysis of where hiring local installers could yield the most savings.</p>
        
        <p>To further assess the viability of in-house installation, data from the Bureau of Economic Research was utilized to calculate travel distances for each order, factoring in hot spot locations. With travel costs reduced, the project then considered the additional expenses of hiring unionized installers, including benefit costs and unemployment taxes.</p>
        
        <p>Despite a potentially more efficient logistical model with in-house workers, the analysis revealed that hiring local installers would result in a net loss of $174,000 annually. Consequently, the company decided to continue its current model of using third-party installation services.</p>

        <p><strong>Key Insights:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Travel Costs as a Key Factor</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>The analysis identified that travel expenses for third-party installers were a significant contributor to overall costs, and hiring local installers could reduce these expenses.</p></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Heatmap Analysis</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>Power BI's heatmap visualization of installation data allowed for geographic identification of "hot spots," highlighting areas where local installation would lead to the greatest cost savings.</p></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Cost Trade-offs</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>While hiring local union installers would reduce travel costs, their higher hourly wages and union benefits created an overall higher cost structure, negating the travel savings.</p></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Financial Impact</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>The analysis revealed a net loss of $174,000 per year if the company switched to an in-house installation model, emphasizing the importance of thorough cost-benefit analysis when evaluating operational changes.</p></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Third-Party Model Stability</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>The conclusion to remain with the third-party installation model was based on a clear financial understanding of the trade-offs, validating the current operational approach.</p></li>
