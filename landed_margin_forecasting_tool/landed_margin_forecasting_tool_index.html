        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>The Freight Margin Forecasting Calculator is a strategic tool for management to evaluate the impact of varying bid margins on the landed margin. Due to a rule limiting the freight charge to a maximum of 20% of the customerâ€™s product order total, standard high-margin bids (such as 46%) often reach this cap, reducing the effective landed margin. By allowing users to adjust the bid margin, the calculator shows the achievable landed margin under these constraints. It also calculates the additional revenue needed from sales to offset reductions in margin, enabling management to make informed decisions that optimize profitability within regulatory pricing limits.</p>

        <h2>Key Insights</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Optimizes Profitability Within Pricing Constraints:</strong> The tool helps management identify optimal margin settings that maximize profitability while staying within the 20% freight charge cap, ensuring compliance with pricing constraints.</li>
            <li><strong>Informed Decision-Making:</strong> By forecasting the effect of different margin levels, the tool supports more informed and strategic decision-making, empowering management to adjust pricing based on detailed margin analysis.</li>
            <li><strong>Addresses Margin Limitations Impact:</strong> The calculator directly addresses the impact of the 20% freight margin cap, showing how high-margin bids (like 46%) might reduce effective landed margins and offering alternatives for better profitability.</li>
            <li><strong>Identifies Cost-Effective Thresholds:</strong> The tool identifies cost-effective thresholds for margin settings, helping management adjust pricing for the highest possible landed margin while complying with internal pricing policies.</li>
