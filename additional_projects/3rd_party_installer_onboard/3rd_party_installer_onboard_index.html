                <li><strong>Company Overview and Product Line Descriptions:</strong> Introduces the new installation company to our company's background, core values, and product lines to familiarize them with brand expectations and the scope of their installation responsibilities.</li>

                <li><strong>Installation Workflow:</strong> Provides a comprehensive breakdown of the installation process, from order acquisition through final site assessment, including key milestones and checkpoints to promote timely, high-quality installations.</li>
                <li><strong>Site Readiness and Scheduling Guidelines:</strong> Offers detailed instructions on evaluating site readiness, coordinating schedules, and preparing for installations, minimizing delays and optimizing efficiency.</li>

            <h2>My Contributions</h2>
            <p>I developed this manual from scratch to assist our team in partnering with new third-party installation companies, helping to expand our footprint in areas where we currently lack resources. I focused on providing as much detail as possible to address any questions a new partner may have, including but not limited to who to contact within our company for assistance with specific topics.</p>
