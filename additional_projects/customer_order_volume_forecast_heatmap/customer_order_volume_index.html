            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>
                The Customer Order Volume Forecast Heatmap was a heatmap of our company's next two years' worth of installations and delivery-only shipments. The installation heatmap took into account all installation orders that were already placed as well as all active quotes that our Sales team was currently working. This heatmap also included markers that marked where our current installation resources were located to help us identify where our shortcomings would be in the next two years.
            </p>
            <p>
                The delivery-only heatmap used all orders that were currently placed over the next two years. There were two heatmaps I developed for the team:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    One based solely on pure delivery counts as if each delivery equaled the same as the next.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The second heatmap took product value into account and weighted it to that metric to help understand where customer damage claims could be highest, so we could prioritize finding higher-quality carriers for those lanes to reduce damage claims.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>My Contributions</h2>
            <p>
                The first thing I had to do for this project was obtain the data for both installations and delivery-only orders for the next two years. I utilized a Salesforce report that I created to gather the data I needed for the installations. Since the installations needed to include both open orders and active quotes, I had to use Salesforce. For delivery-only orders, I utilized a Power BI report that I created, which pulls data from our ERP (Epicor). From there, I was able to start writing the script that I mentioned above.
