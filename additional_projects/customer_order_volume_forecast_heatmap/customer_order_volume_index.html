            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>
                The Customer Order Volume Forecast Heatmap is a tool designed to help forecast customer order volumes for installations and delivery-only shipments over the next two years. It uses active orders and quotes to predict demand and resource needs, as well as to identify potential service gaps.
            </p>
            <p>
                The heatmap for installations includes placed orders and active quotes from the Sales team, with markers showing the locations of current installation resources. This visualizes potential resource shortages over the next two years.
            </p>
            <p>
                The delivery-only heatmap factors in both order volumes and product value, helping us anticipate areas where high-value deliveries may lead to increased customer claims. This visualization was used to prioritize lanes with higher-value shipments to secure better quality carriers and reduce risk.

            <h2>My Contributions</h2>
            <p>
                I developed the Customer Order Volume Forecast Heatmap tool from the ground up, integrating multiple data sources such as orders and quotes to forecast customer demand and resource allocation over the next two years. I used geospatial analysis to visualize installation resources and identify gaps, ensuring that our teams could prepare for future resource needs.
            </p>
            <p>
                Additionally, I created two distinct heatmaps: one based on raw delivery counts, and another weighted by product revenue to anticipate customer claims and prioritize high-value lanes. This tool provided invaluable insights to optimize logistics and carrier selection, enhancing the team's decision-making process.
